== Setting up Client Tools Lab
:!numbered:

=== Goals
After completing this lab, you should be able to:

* Locate the binaries for the OpenShift Container Platform command-line interface (CLI).
* Install the OCP CLI tools.
* CLI basic configuration.

=== Locating the binaries
The OCP CLI exposes commands for managing applications, as well as lower-level tools to interact with each component of the system. The binaries for Mac, Windows, and Linux are available for download from the Red Hat Customer Portal via the following link:

 * link:https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290[Red Hat Customer Support Portal]

=== Installing the CLI tools
The CLI is provided as compressed files that can be decompressed to any directory. In order to make it simple for any user to access the OSE CLI, it is recommended that it is made available in a directory mapped to the environment variable called `PATH` from the OS.
More information can be found about installation process and link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html[getting started with CLI documentation].

==== OSX and Linux
. Copy the binary to the `/usr/local/bin` directory, or one of the paths listed in the `PATH` environment variable.

==== Windows
. Use `oc.exe` to open an OpenShift shell.
	If you getting error from running `oc`, go to link:git-scm.com to download git bash for Windows (during installation you need to specify in the selection to integrate with the command prompt)
. Download and install *Notepad++* and install the JSON plugin or use link:http://jsonlint.com[] to edit and validate JSON.

[NOTE]
This link:http://ammonsonline.com/formatted-json-in-notepad/[link] describes the steps on how to use *Notepad++* to format JSON content
+
. Configure your default editor to be *Notepad++*.

=== CLI basic configuration

The easiest way to initially setup the OpenShift CLI is to use the `oc login`
command. It'll interactively ask you a server URL, username and password. The
information is automatically saved in a CLI configuration file that is then used
for subsequent commands.

To login to a remote server use:

-----
oc login <hostname>:<port>
-----
